        <p>In 2001, the then Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government extended the freeze on the delimitation of the Lok Sabha and Assembly seats on the basis of the 1971 Census till 2026. Introducing a Constitutional Amendment Bill in the Lok Sabha in this regard on August 21, 2001, then Union Law Minister Arun Jaitley said that delimitation should be frozen for another 25 years as there are “some states which have implemented the family planning programme very effectively and there are some states where it has not been effectively implemented”.

Senior Congress leader Shivraj Patil then proposed a formula based on a proportional increase of seats to ensure that states which successfully controlled their population were not penalised.

Currently, a delimitation storm is brewing in the South with Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and DMK president M K Stalin emerging as its key voice opposing the population-based exercise over fears that southern states would lose out on the Lok Sabha seats. An all-party meeting that Stalin recently held in Chennai asked the Centre that the 1971 Census should remain the basis for any allocation of seats through delimitation for 30 more years beyond 2026. On August 21, 2001, participating in the debate on the Constitutional Amendment Bill, Shivraj Patil, while asserting that he would vote as per his Congress party’s line in favour of the Bill, expressed concern over the fact that MPs in India had to represent very large numbers of people because of the 1971 Census figures being used even in 2001..</p>
